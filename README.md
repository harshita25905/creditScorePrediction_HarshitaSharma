  Project Overview
Credit Score Prediction is an AI-based solution that helps financial institutions determine the creditworthiness of individuals. This project uses Logistic Regression to classify credit scores as Good (1) or Bad (0) based on financial data like income, loan amount, and credit history.

üîç How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection: The dataset contains financial information such as Age, Income, Loan Amount, and Credit History.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature selection.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training: Using Logistic Regression to train the model on historical data.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation: Measuring accuracy and analyzing predictions with a confusion matrix.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization: Generating graphs for credit score distribution and model performance.
